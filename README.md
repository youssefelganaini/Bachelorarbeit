## Abstract 

Enabling financial access to unbanked and financially underserved segments of the population remains an important challenge in emerging markets. In Egypt, financial inclusion is an important element of the Central Bankâ€™s long-term national strategy. This study investigates the underlying determinants of formal financial institution usage in Egypt with a specific focus on predicting formal saving and borrowing. We use the fourth wave of the Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey, a nationally representa-
tive survey covering a wide range of topics. Using logistic regression, we find that for

saving, being male, attaining tertiary education, residing in urban areas as well as be-
longing to higher wealth quantiles are all significant predictors. Being male, attaining

tertiary education and age are significant for formal borrowing. Our results suggest

policy implications, including addressing the gender wealth gap and embracing finan-
cial technology solutions to enhance financial access.
